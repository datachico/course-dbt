**4. Setting up for production / scheduled dbt run of your project And finally, before you fly free into the dbt night, we will take a step back and reflect: after learning about the various options for dbt deployment and seeing your final dbt project, how would you go about setting up a production/scheduled dbt run of your project in an ideal state? You donâ€™t have to actually set anything up - just jot down what you would do and why and post in a README file. Hints: what steps would you have? Which orchestration tool(s) would you be interested in using? What schedule would you run your project on? Which metadata would you be interested in using? How/why would you use the specific metadata? , etc.**
